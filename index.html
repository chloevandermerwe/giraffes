      <h2>Introduction to Giraffes</h2>
          <p>The giraffe is a tall African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing giraffes into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.</p>
          <p>The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its spotted coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.</p>
          <p>Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking,” which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.</p>
          <p>The giraffe has intrigued various ancient and modern cultures for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as vulnerable to extinction and has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves, but estimates as of 2016 indicate there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.</p>


      <h2>Etymology</h2>
          <p>The name "giraffe" has its earliest known origins in the Arabic word zarāfah (زرافة),[2] perhaps borrowed from the animal's Somali name geri.[3] The Arab name is translated as "fast-walker".[4] In early Modern English the spellings jarraf and ziraph were used, probably directly from the Arabic,[5] and in Middle English orafle and gyrfaunt, gerfaunt. The Italian form giraffa arose in the 1590s. The modern English form developed around 1600 from the French girafe.[2]</p>
          <p>"Camelopard" /kəˈmɛləˌpɑːrd/ is an archaic English name for the giraffe; it derives from the Ancient Greek καμηλοπάρδαλις (kamēlopárdalis), from κάμηλος (kámēlos), "camel", and πάρδαλις (párdalis), "leopard", referring to its camel-like shape and leopard-like colouration.[6][7]</p>

      <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
        <h3>Evolution</h3>
          <p>Carl Linnaeus originally classified living giraffes as one species in 1758. He gave it the binomial name Cervus camelopardalis. Morten Thrane Brünnich classified the genus Giraffa in 1762.[8] The species name camelopardalis is from Latin.[9]</p>
          <p>The giraffe is one of only two living genera of the family Giraffidae in the order Artiodactyla, the other being the okapi. The family was once much more extensive, with over 10 fossil genera described.[11] The elongation of the neck appears to have started early in the giraffe lineage. Comparisons between giraffes and their ancient relatives suggest vertebrae close to the skull lengthened earlier, followed by lengthening of vertebrae further down.[12] One early giraffid ancestor was Canthumeryx which has been dated variously to have lived 25–20 million years ago (mya), 17–15 mya or 18–14.3 mya and whose deposits have been found in Libya. This animal was medium-sized, slender and antelope-like. Giraffokeryx appeared 15 mya on the Indian subcontinent and resembled an okapi or a small giraffe, and had a longer neck and similar ossicones.[11] Giraffokeryx may have shared a clade with more massively built giraffids like Sivatherium and Bramatherium.[12]</p>
          <p>Giraffids like Palaeotragus, Shansitherium and Samotherium appeared 14 mya and lived throughout Africa and Eurasia. These animals had bare ossicones and small cranial sinuses and were longer with broader skulls.[11][12] Paleotragus resembled the okapi and may have been its ancestor.[11] Others find that the okapi lineage diverged earlier, before Giraffokeryx.[12] Samotherium was a particularly important transitional fossil in the giraffe lineage, as its cervical vertebrae were intermediate in length and structure between a modern giraffe and an okapi, and were more vertical than the okapi's.[13] Bohlinia, which first appeared in southeastern Europe and lived 9–7 mya was likely a direct ancestor of the giraffe. Bohlinia closely resembled modern giraffes, having a long neck and legs and similar ossicones and dentition.[11]</p>
          <p>Bohlinia entered China and northern India in response to climate change. From there, the genus Giraffa evolved and, around 7 mya, entered Africa.[14] Further climate changes caused the extinction of the Asian giraffes, while the African giraffes survived and radiated into several new species. Living giraffes appear to have arisen around 1 mya in eastern Africa during the Pleistocene.[11] Some biologists suggest the modern giraffes descended from G. jumae;[15] others find G. gracilis a more likely candidate.[11] G. jumae was larger and more heavily built, while G. gracilis was smaller and more lightly built.[11]</p>
          <p>The changes from extensive forests to more open habitats, which began 8 mya, are believed to be the main driver for the evolution of giraffes.[11] During this time, tropical plants disappeared and were replaced by arid C4 plants, and a dry savannah emerged across eastern and northern Africa and western India.[16][17] Some researchers have hypothesised that this new habitat coupled with a different diet, including acacia species, may have exposed giraffe ancestors to toxins that caused higher mutation rates and a higher rate of evolution.[18] The coat patterns of modern giraffes may also have coincided with these habitat changes. Asian giraffes are hypothesised to have had more okapi-like colourations.[11]</p>
          <p>The giraffe genome is around 2.9 billion base pairs in length compared to the 3.3 billion base pairs of the okapi. Of the proteins in giraffe and okapi genes, 19.4% are identical. The divergence of giraffe and okapi lineages dates to around 11.5 mya. A small group of regulatory genes in the giraffe appear to be responsible for the animal's stature and associated circulatory adaptations.[19]</p>
        <h3>Species and Subspecies</h3>
          <p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) currently recognises only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies.[1] During the 1900s, various taxonomies with two or three species were proposed.[21] A 2007 study on the genetics of giraffes using mitochondrial DNA suggested at least six lineages could be recognised as species.[20] A 2011 study using detailed analyses of the morphology of giraffes, and application of the phylogenetic species concept, described eight species of living giraffes.[22] A 2016 study also concluded that living giraffes consist of multiple species. The researchers suggested the existence of four species, which have not exchanged genetic information between each other for 1 to 2 million years.[23]</p>
          <p>A 2020 study showed that depending on the method chosen, different taxonomic hypotheses recognizing from two to six species can be considered for the genus Giraffa.[24] That study also found that multi-species coalescent methods can lead to taxonomic over-splitting, as those methods delimit geographic structures rather than species. The three-species hypothesis, which recognises G. camelopardalis, G. giraffa, and G. tippelskirchi, is highly supported by phylogenetic analyses and also corroborated by most population genetic and multi-species coalescent analyses.[24] A 2021 whole genome sequencing study suggests the existence of four distinct species and seven subspecies.[25]</p>
          <p>The cladogram below shows the phylogenetic relationship between the four proposed species and seven subspecies based on the genome analysis.[25] Note the eight lineages correspond to eight of the traditional subspecies in the one species hypothesis. The Rothschild giraffe is subsumed into G. camelopardalis camelopardalis.</p>
      <h2>Appearance and Anatomy</h2>
          <p>Fully grown giraffes stand 4.3–5.7 m (14.1–18.7 ft) tall, with males taller than females.[45] The average weight is 1,192 kg (2,628 lb) for an adult male and 828 kg (1,825 lb) for an adult female.[46] Despite its long neck and legs, the giraffe's body is relatively short.[47]: 66  The skin of a giraffe is mostly gray,[46] or tan,[48] and can reach a thickness of 20 mm (0.79 in).[49]: 87  The 80–100 centimetres (31–39 in) long[38] tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.[49]: 94 </p>
          <p>The coat has dark blotches or patches, which can be orange, chestnut, brown, or nearly black, separated by light hair, usually white or cream coloured.[50] Male giraffes become darker as they age.[42] The coat pattern has been claimed to serve as camouflage in the light and shade patterns of savannah woodlands.[38] When standing among trees and bushes, they are hard to see at even a few metres distance. However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves rather than on camouflage, which may be more important for calves.[11] Each individual giraffe has a unique coat pattern.[42] Giraffe calves inherit some coat pattern traits from their mothers, and variation in some spot traits is correlated with neonatal survival.[41] The skin underneath the blotches may serve as windows for thermoregulation, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands.[51]</p>
          <p>The fur may give the animal chemical defense, as its parasite repellents give it a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although indole and 3-methylindole are responsible for most of the smell. Because the males have a stronger odour than the females, the odour may also have sexual function.[52]</p>
        <h3>Head</h3>
          <p>Both sexes have prominent horn-like structures called ossicones, formed from ossified cartilage, covered in skin and fused to the skull at the parietal bones.[42] Being vascularised, the ossicones may have a role in thermoregulation,[51] and are used in combat between males.[53] Appearance is a reliable guide to the sex or age of a giraffe: the ossicones of females and young are thin and display tufts of hair on top, whereas those of adult males end in knobs and tend to be bald on top.[42] Also, a median lump, which is more prominent in males, emerges at the front of the skull.[8] Males develop calcium deposits that form bumps on their skulls as they age.[50] Multiple sinuses lighten a giraffe's skull.[49]: 103  However, as males age, their skulls become heavier and more club-like, helping them become more dominant in combat.[42] The occipital condyles of the skull allow the animal to tilt its head straight up and grab food on the branches above with the tongue.[49]: 103, 110 </p>
          <p>Located on both sides of the head, the giraffe's eyes give it good eyesight and a wide field of vision from its great height.[49]: 85, 102  The eye is larger than in other ungulates, with a greater retinal surface area.[54] Giraffes possibly see in colour[49]: 85  and their senses of hearing and smell are sharp.[50] The ears are movable[49]: 95  and the nostrils are slit-shaped, which may be an adaptation against blowing sand.[55]</p>
          <p>The giraffe's prehensile tongue is about 45 cm (18 in) long. It is black, perhaps to protect against sunburn and is useful for grasping foliage, and delicately removing leaves from branches.[49]: 109–110  The giraffe's upper lip is prehensile and useful when foraging, and is covered in hair to protect against thorns. Papillae cover the tongue and the inside of the mouth.[8] The upper jaw has a hard palate and lacks front teeth. The molars and premolars have a low-crowned, broad surface with an almost square cross-section.[49]: 106 </p>
        <h3>Legs, Locomotion and Posture</h3>
          <p>ulna of the front legs are articulated by the carpus, which, while structurally equivalent to the human wrist, functions as a knee.[56] It appears that a suspensory ligament allows the lanky legs to support the animal's great weight.[57] The hooves of large male giraffes reach a diameter of 31 cm × 23 cm (12.2 in × 9.1 in).[49]: 98  The rear of each hoof is low, and the fetlock is close to the ground, allowing the foot to provide additional support for the animal's weight. Giraffes lack dewclaws and interdigital glands. The giraffe's pelvis, though relatively short, has an ilium that is outspread at the upper ends.[8]</p>
          <p>A giraffe has only two gaits: walking and galloping. Walking is done by moving the legs on one side of the body, then doing the same on the other side.[42] When galloping, the hind legs move around the front legs before the latter move forward,[50] and the tail will curl up.[42] The animal relies on the forward and backward motions of its head and neck to maintain balance and the counter momentum while galloping.[35]: 327–29  The giraffe can reach a sprint speed of up to 60 km/h (37 mph),[58] and can sustain 50 km/h (31 mph) for several kilometres.[59] Giraffes would probably not be competent swimmers as their long legs would be highly cumbersome in the water,[60] although they could possibly float.[61] When swimming, the thorax would be weighed down by the front legs, making it difficult for the animal to move its neck and legs in harmony[60][61] or keep its head above the water's surface.[60]</p>
          <p>A giraffe rests by lying with its body on top of its folded legs.[35]: 329  To lie down, the animal kneels on its front legs and then lowers the rest of its body. To get back up, it first gets on its front knees and shifts hindquarters onto its back feet. It then moves from kneeling to standing on its front legs and pulls the rest of its body upwards, swinging its head for balance.[49]: 67  If the giraffe wants to bend down to drink, it either spreads its front legs or bends its knees.[42] Studies in captivity found the giraffe sleeps intermittently around 4.6 hours per day, mostly at night. It usually sleeps lying down; however, standing sleeps have been recorded, particularly in older individuals. Intermittent short "deep sleep" phases while lying are characterised by the giraffe bending its neck backwards and resting its head on the hip or thigh, a position believed to indicate paradoxical sleep.[62]</p>
